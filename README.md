# Fixed Point Iteration
A Python Flask API that is capable of finding roots with Fixed Point Iteration Method. This version is not capable of handling complex, and negative roots. It can still calculate negative x = g(x) equations but iteration doesn't converge for those cases.

This project developed as an homework for Numerical Analysis course provided by [Dr. Bora Canbula](https://www.github.com/canbula) at Celal Bayar University. Here is [the repository of the lesson.](https://github.com/canbula/NumericalAnalysis)

Here is a video demonstration:
