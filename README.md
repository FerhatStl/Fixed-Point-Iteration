# Fixed Point Iteration
 A Python Flask API that is capable of finding roots with Fixed Point Iteration Method.
 This version is not capable of handling complex, and negative roots. It can still calculate negative x = g(x) equations but iteration doesn't converge for those cases.
 Video.mp4 has an example usage of the API.
 This project developed as an homework for Numerical Analysis course provided by Celal Bayar University.

Here is a video demonstration:
